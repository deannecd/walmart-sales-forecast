# Walmart Sales Forecasting
# https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data

# Predict the department-wide sales for each store

# 45 stores

# Some ideas:
# Time series forecasting per store, adjust for seasonal trends
# Mean sales between holiday and non-holiday (ANOVA)
# Mean sales per day of the week (ANOVA)
# Mean sales per year (ANOVA)
# Mean sales per quarter (ANOVA)
# Mean sales of stores (ANOVA)
# Mean sales preceding: (1) Super Bowl, (2) Labor Day, 
# (3) Thanksgiving, and (4) Christmas versus ordinary day (ANOVA) 
# Time series regression of Sales adjusting for temperature,
# CPI (inflation), Fuel price, and Unemployment rate
